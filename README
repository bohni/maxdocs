MaxDocs is a new wiki approach focusing on the following features

	* Cool URIs dont change (http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI)

	* simple templating

	* Support of different markups

It uses a branching model that is inspired by Vincent Driessen's model on his blog post at
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Macdocs defines the following branches:

	* master corresponds to the develop branch in Vincent's model 

	* releases corresponds to the master branch in Vincent's model.
