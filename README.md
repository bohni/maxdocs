[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bohni/maxdocs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bohni/maxdocs)

MaxDocs is a new wiki approach focusing on the following features

* [Cool URIs dont change](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI)
* simple templating with jsp custom tags
* consistent use of UTF-8
* Support of different markups

It uses a branching model that is inspired by Vincent Driessen's model on his [blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model)

Macdocs defines the following branches:

* master corresponds to the develop branch in Vincent's model 
* releases corresponds to the master branch in Vincent's model.
